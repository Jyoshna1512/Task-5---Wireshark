## 🎯 Objective
Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.

## 🛠 What I Did
- Installed and opened Wireshark
- Captured traffic on my Wi-Fi interface
- Opened websites and used the ping command
- Stopped capture and saved .pcap file

## 🔍 Protocols Identified
1. *TCP* – Used for reliable data transfer
2. *TLSv1.2* – Used for secure HTTPS communication
3. *UDP* – Often used in DNS or media streaming

## 📁 Output
- task5-capture.pcap (Wireshark file)
- Screenshots of live capture

## 🧠 Learnings
I learned how to use Wireshark, filter traffic, and understand basic protocols like TCP, UDP, and TLS.
